# 👂 Listen & Repeat 🗣️

</div>

Since I need to pass TOEFL (new format from 2026), I decided to make a tool
that helps me with the "Listen & Repeat" section. Even though I speak fairly
fluently, it's still hard to repeat exactly what they say. On top of that, the
BEEP sound makes me anxious 😭.

If you feel the same, welcome!

### ⚙️ Usage

To start, simply run:

```bash
python ./listen-and-repeat.py samples/zoo.txt
```

The script will ask you to select the best microphone you have. After
selecting, the test will begin.

After the test, you'll see where you made mistakes. For more details, you can
check the out/ directory, which contains the recorded samples and text
recognition logs.

> [!TIP]
> Since this script is not AI-powered and keeps your recordings
> locally so you can practice in your own space, the recognition quality is limited.
> But if you score more than 80% here, you'll definitely succeed on TOEFL.
