We have a variety of wildlife.
Bears, wolves, and large cats are to the right.
You can find sea lions and elephants further down the path.
Please, no outside food or drinks, and do not feed the animals.
Avoid banging or tapping on the displays and enclosures.
For those with children, we offer summer camps and educational opportunities.
The visitor’s center, located near the front entrance, can give you more information.
